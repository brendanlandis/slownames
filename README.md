- make some Receive art with this: https://aniso.studiofreight.com/

+ First goal is get data populating in the dropdown.
+ Then adjust the permissions in Strapi to only allow authenticated users to do that.
+ then figure out how to send that get request authenticatedly
+ Then figure out how to load the page authenticatedly
- Then figure out how to send a post request authenticatedly (i.e. change the user's primary band)
- Then do the other stuff on the page



TODO after auth stuff:
- news page -> relationship picker is too wide for mobile
- decide on case & tone or whatever for labels sitewide


POTENTIALLY COOL PLUGINS AND STUFF:
- grids for dealing with old stuff: https://ui.toast.com/tui-grid
- comboboxes / autocompletes: https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift
- date picker: https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-date-picker/


COULD BE COOL FOR OTHER SITES:
- static site generator: https://astro.build/
- svelte and sveltekit also seem cool: https://svelte.dev/ https://kit.svelte.dev/
